## **Software Setup**

### **Folder Structure**

1. Create a folder named `yolo` on your Desktop.
2. Paste the `app.py` file inside the `yolo` folder.
3. Copy all files from the `model` folder (YOLO model files) and paste them inside `yolo`.
4. Create a folder named `templates` inside `yolo` and paste `index.html` inside it.
5. Create a folder named `static` inside `yolo` and paste `style.css` and `script.js` inside it.

Your folder should now look like this:
